This is my first project of Internship. I have built scientific calculator which allows users to perform some common mathematical calculations and manage their calculation history.

-   Expression Evaluation: 
    The calculator can evaluate mathematical expressions that include basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), exponents (^), and common trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, sqrt).
-   Operator Precedence: 
    The expression evaluation respects the different operator precedence levels correctly.
-   Input Handling: 
    The calculator supports both ways to input expressions, including typing directly into the display using keyboard and using buttons. Users can use the keyboard to input expressions and trigger calculation by pressing the Enter key.
-   History:
    The calculator maintains a history of previous calculations, allowing users to review and delete entries. Users can also clear the entire calculation history.
-   Display: 
    The calculator displays the current expression and the result.
-   Utility Functions: 
    The calculator provides functions to clear the display, clear the last input, and clear the entire history.
-   Error Handling: 
    The calculator can detect and handle errors, such as division by zero, and display an appropriate error message.
